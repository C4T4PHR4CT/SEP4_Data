Sprint review, rerospective, and planning meeting

Review: 

10:45 - meeting start

Levente - data part OK, minor issues
Samantha - DWH problems
Shaoyu - DWH problems

Daria - IoT part OK, only needs connection fix and polishing
Mihai - better than expected considering impediments
Natali - all planned completed

Kristóf - Android part OK, still needs improvements
Bogdan - dashboard needs improvements, but most things done
Uldis - mostly just minor issues with what we have

Incomplete stuff: 

data - DWH needs to be finalized
IoT - connecting the data server and the gateway
Android - just improvements

Ongoing work recommendations: 

user stories 2, 3, 4 - atomic requirements, very basic, many others build on it (Levente, Mihai, Samantha, Shaoyu, Daria, Bogdan, Uldis, Kristóf)
possible addition - 14 (same reasons) (Natali, Samantha, Shaoyu, Daria, Bogdan, Uldis, Kristóf, Levente, Mihai)
possible addition - 1 (same reasons) (Kristóf, Levente, Mihai, Natali, Samantha, Shaoyu, Daria, Bogdan, Uldis)



11:10 - Sprint retrospective:

Kristóf - more communication between teams
Levente - more hand-in-hand collaboration
Mihai - same as Kristóf
Natali - same as Mihai
Samantha - same as Natali, same as Levente
Shaoyu - better common understanding, same as Natali
Daria - same as Mihai
Bogdan - same as Shaoyu
Uldis - same as Bogdan

Issue 1 - more communication between teams - schedule meetings for collaboration - eg. between tech leads, quick support initiated by person needing help
Issue 2 - more hand-in-hand collaboration - better task management, small discussions before implementation to integrate parts
Issue 3 - better common understanding - small discussions before implementation to integrate parts, finalizing models and designs (possibly more) - between teams
