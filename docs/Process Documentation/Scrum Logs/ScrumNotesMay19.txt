Sprint review, rerospective, and planning meeting

Review: 

10:30 - meeting start

Levente - model finalized, current state DB and API server is done/deployed, ETL is in progress for DWH. 
Shaoyu - incremental load is in progress
Audrius - documentation in progress (5-step docs for DB/DWH)

Daria - nearly all code implemented (including actuator, but that has problems - fixing in progress), needs documentation, architecture needs review
Natali - gateway API also done

Kristóf - UI completed, authentication, architecture done
Uldis - same

Incomplete stuff: 

data - ETL, integration of Gateway app
IoT - actuator needs fixes
Android - visualization (pushed to next sprint as planned)

Ongoing work recommendations: 

User story 6 is in progress.
User stories 7 and 9 is to be worked on.
User stories 8, 12 and 15 is to be worked on/in progress.



10:55 - Sprint retrospective:

Kristóf - most issues improved a lot, we need to talk more about reports to split up work
Levente - most issues improved
Audrius - agreed with Levente, problems with misunderstandings, but those were fixed
Natali - no problems, teamwork is good during this sprint
Shaoyu - same as Natali
Daria - inter-team collaboration
Uldis - same as Natali, good emergency communication if help was needed
Samantha - better on previous issues, but workflow feels inefficient but actually isn't

Issue 1 - talk more about reports - split up report into parts by individual persons working on it by the subgroups
Reports should be reviewed by entire subgroup, then merged into the big report by the entire group.


Sprint planning (sprint 3 - construction)

12:30 - meeting start
12:34 - IoT team planned
12:50 - data team planned
12:54 - android team planned
13:00 - acceptance criteria clarified (1. Working pipeline from Android to IoT, 2. DWH works, proven by ETL scripts running on dummy data)
13:00 - vote called on sprint plan, resolved 6 votes to 0.


Conclusions: previous sprint reviewed, current sprint planned successfully, team will proceed as planned.
